format of files should work with platformio

when transfering to platformio project:
> include header files in main.cpp 
> #include <vector.hpp> // don't worry about file path
> all hpp and cpp files should go in lib/
> constants.hpp and pins.hpp should go in include/

to compile and run with g++, run compile.bat
